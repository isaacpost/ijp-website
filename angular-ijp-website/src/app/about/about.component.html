    <h1>Hi, I'm Isaac.</h1>

    <h2>
        I'm an enthusiastic and ideas-driven software engineer studying at Rochester Institute of Technology.

        cloud engineering, game development, and music production.

    <h1>Get to Know Me!</h1>

    <h2>
      I live in downtown Rochester, NY with my girlfriend Mikayla and our wonderful cat Frida. 
      As a software developer, it's probably no suprise that I am a big nerd. Some of my hobbies
      include playing and speedrunning video games, watching movies with my friends, and playing tabletop 
      games like Magic: The Gathering. I also produce music in my free time, which you can check out on my 
      YouTube channel!
