    <h1>Get to Know Me!</h1>

    <h2>
      I live in downtown Rochester, NY with my girlfriend Mikayla and our wonderful cat, 
      Frida. Even though most of my time is spent programming, I am quite involved with many other activities. 
      Some of my hobbies include performing in musical theater and improv shows at my college and 
      local theaters, playing and speedrunning video games, and competing in tabletop games like 
      Magic: The Gathering. I also produce electronic music in my free time, which you can check 
      out on the Music page.
